\char`\"{}\+Game Engine\char`\"{} is an unimaginatively named set of bindings for \href{https://www.libsdl.org/}{\tt S\+D\+L2} with an embedded \href{https://v8.dev/docs}{\tt v8 Javascript engine}. Its sole purpose for the moment is educational. It is not intened to be a competitor to other tools already available, such as \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/sdl}{\tt node-\/sdl} or the many \href{https://github.com/collections/javascript-game-engines}{\tt Javascript game engines}

From the Javascript side, access to the Game Engine is provided through a global module called \char`\"{}\+G\+E\char`\"{}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
use strict;
const mod = GE.Modules();
mod.require("SDL");
\end{DoxyCode}


Each call to mod.\+require() will initialize new modules within the global object. After {\ttfamily mod.\+require(\char`\"{}\+S\+D\+L\char`\"{})} we can then say things like {\ttfamily const win = S\+D\+L.\+Window()}


\begin{DoxyCode}
const init\_flags = SDL.InitFlags();
const window\_flags = SDL.WindowFlags();
const render\_flags = SDL.RenderFlags();
const pixel\_format = SDL.Pixelformat();
const texture\_access = SDL.TextureAccess();
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Compiling and running}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item read \mbox{\hyperlink{md_requirements}{the requirements}} and edit {\ttfamily Cmake\+Lists.\+txt} then do 
\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make shell
\end{DoxyCode}

\item in the build directory run a test program with 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./shell ./js/init.js
\end{DoxyCode}
 
\end{DoxyItemize}
